# Exploring New York City Airbnb Data through Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the **New York City Airbnb** data using various tools and techniques to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and relationships between Airbnb listings and other factors like pricing, crime, and neighborhood characteristics. The analysis and visualizations aim to help in making informed decisions regarding Airbnb listings in New York City.

## Tools and Libraries Used

### Primary Tools:
- **Tableau**: Used for data visualization, creating interactive dashboards, and sharing insights.
- **Jupyter Notebook with Python**: Used for data analysis, model development, and visualization.
  
### Python Libraries:
- **Matplotlib**: Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for machine learning models, including regression analysis.
- **Tree Interpreter**: Used for interpreting decision tree models.

## Data Sources
- **Tableau** connects to various data sources such as:
  - Excel
  - CSV
  - SQL Server
  - Google Analytics

## Project Implementation

### Tableau Dashboards
The following Tableau sheets were created to provide insights from the data:
1. **Average Price by Neighborhood Group and Room Type**: Displays the average price of Airbnb listings based on neighborhood and room type.
2. **Top 10 Hosts by Total Reviews**: Lists the top 10 hosts with the highest number of reviews.
3. **Total Reviews by Year**: Shows the total number of reviews for each year.
4. **Average Price by Neighborhood Group and Neighborhood**: Displays the average price per neighborhood group and neighborhood.

### Key Insights from Tableau
- **Neighborhood Groups & Room Types**: Insights into the average price of listings by neighborhood and room type.
- **Crime Data Visualization**: Identifying patterns in crime incidents, using color coding to indicate crime rates and highlighting locations with higher crime.
- **Crime Demographics**: Pie charts visualizing crime and victim demographics, including age and gender distributions.

### Data Analysis and Models
- **Regression Analysis**: Linear regression models were used to identify relationships and predict trends between various independent variables (e.g., pricing, crime rates).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzed text data using natural language processing (NLP) to determine sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) from reviews and feedback.
  
### Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis was used to understand customer emotions and feedback, helping to gauge customer sentiment towards specific Airbnb listings or areas.

## Outcomes and Insights
- **Crime and Airbnb Listings**: A high concentration of both Airbnb listings and reported crimes is seen mainly in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
- **Property Types**: Airbnb listings in public housing and apartment buildings tend to have a higher concentration of reported crimes than private houses or hotel/motels.
- **Population & Income Influence**: Areas with higher population density and income levels appear to have a greater influence on crime rates.
- **Seasonality and Crime Rates**: Crime rates increase during peak tourist seasons, especially in areas with a high number of Airbnb listings.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listings in New York City, integrating data visualization and regression analysis to uncover key trends and relationships. The findings can be used to make informed decisions about Airbnb stays, including safety considerations and pricing strategies.
